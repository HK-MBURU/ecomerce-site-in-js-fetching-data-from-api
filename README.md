# ecomerce-site-in-js-fetching-data-from-api
this website I made while learning Vanilla Javascript. Throuh it I have been able to implement local storage, fetch api and event listeners.
Though it is not complete it is somehow working well but I will upload more commits to provide it with full functionality it is an ecomerce site
that is supposed to add items to cart and sell.
